% Set the document class to "article"
% Pass it "letterpaper" option
\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}

% We don't need the special font encodings, but still
% good practice to include these. See:

% Now define the header. Make the text bold.
% We'll get something like:

% 123456789             LaTeX 101       123456789
% J. Random Student   Assignment N      J. Random Student

% This layout is pretty simple, and should be enough for an assignment
% If you want more, you can consult the documentation
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.pdf
\lhead{\textbf{\ido\\ \nameo}}
\chead{\textbf{\course\\ \assignment}}
\rhead{\textbf{\idt\\ \namet}}

% Here is an example for customising the numbering
% It changes the first level of numbering to bolded (a), (b), (c), etc
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\textbf{\alph{enumi}. }}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\theenumi}
% Other options to play with are to change \theenumii, \labelenumii, and enumii for the second level of nesting,
% and so on to \theenumiv, \labelenumiv, and enumiv for the fourth level of nesting.
% The possible formats are \arabic (1, 2...), \alph (a, b...), \Alph (A, B...), \roman (i, ii...), and \Roman (I, II...)

% Begin the actual typesetting, by starting the "document" environment
