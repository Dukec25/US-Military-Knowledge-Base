% Other options to play with are to change \theenumii, \labelenumii, and enumii for the second level of nesting,

% The possible formats are \arabic (1, 2...), \alph (a, b...), \Alph (A, B...), \roman (i, ii...), and \Roman (I, II...)

  \section*{Experimental Plan}

  	\begin{enumerate}
  		\item
  		We plan to research natural language resource issues. 
      Our goal is to extend our ontology using Leixon entries, NL Names and Sentence Plans.
  		We would like to explore text generation using NL resources, and the effect of of enriching these resources 
      on the generated text.
  		We will be documenting our steps and results throughout this process so that we have sufficient information 
      to make informal evaluations and educated guesses.

  		\item
  		Our primary domain ontology is a knowledge base focused on World War 2.
      It contains information about the different participants and alliances fighting the war.
      We also model different engagements in various locations, and the types of units taking part in these engagements.
      The ontology also contains information about the different types of commanders leading different units, and
      the types of army men taking part in the war.

  		\item
      We do not plan to use any existing ontologies. However we plan to use the sample Natural Language resources as a
      guide while creating our own. This will serve as a benchmark for enriching our resources.

  		\item
      We plan to create the following extensions to the natural language resources.

  		\item
      We will test the effect of adding more sentence plans and other natural language resources on the generated text.
      Our hypotheses is that an increase in the natural language resources should lead to a more fluent and gramatically
      accurate text.    
      These resources should help form proper sentences with pronouns and be similar to language used in daily life.
